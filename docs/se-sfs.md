To adapt **Simplified Silhouette Sequential Forward Selection (SS-SFS)** for **Sammon error** minimization in unsupervised feature selection, you can modify the feature selection process to focus on minimizing **Sammon error** instead of optimizing the silhouette score. Here's how you can approach it:

### Steps for Using SS-SFS with Sammon Error Minimization

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an **empty set** of selected features \( F_{\text{selected}} \).
   - Define the **full feature set** \( F_{\text{all}} \), containing all features in your dataset.

2. **Compute Pairwise Distances for Full Dataset:**
   - Compute the pairwise distances between all data points based on the entire feature set (all features combined). This serves as your reference for calculating Sammon error later.
   - If you have \( n \) data points, the distance matrix \( D_{\text{full}} \) will have dimensions \( n \times n \).

3. **Select the First Feature:**
   - For each feature \( f_i \in F_{\text{all}} \), compute the **Sammon error** based on the distances calculated using only that feature.
   - The **Sammon error** for feature \( f_i \) is:

     \[
     E_{f_i} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i<j} d_{ij}} \sum_{i<j} \frac{(d_{ij} - \delta_{ij})^2}{d_{ij}}
     \]

     Where:
     - \( d_{ij} \) is the original pairwise distance between points \( i \) and \( j \) using all features.
     - \( \delta_{ij} \) is the pairwise distance between points \( i \) and \( j \) using only feature \( f_i \).

   - Select the feature \( f_{\text{best}} \) that **minimizes Sammon error** and add it to the set \( F_{\text{selected}} \).

4. **Sequential Forward Selection:**
   - In each subsequent step, iteratively add one feature at a time by evaluating combinations of the currently selected features and one additional feature.

   For each unselected feature \( f_i \in F_{\text{all}} - F_{\text{selected}} \):
   - Compute the pairwise distances using the current set of selected features \( F_{\text{selected}} \cup \{f_i\} \).
   - Calculate the **Sammon error** using this subset of features:

     \[
     E_{F_{\text{selected}} \cup \{f_i\}} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i<j} d_{ij}} \sum_{i<j} \frac{(d_{ij} - \delta_{ij}^{\text{selected}})^2}{d_{ij}}
     \]

     Where:
     - \( d_{ij} \) is the original pairwise distance between points \( i \) and \( j \) using all features.
     - \( \delta_{ij}^{\text{selected}} \) is the distance between points \( i \) and \( j \) using the selected features \( F_{\text{selected}} \cup \{f_i\} \).

   - Select the feature \( f_{\text{best}} \) that minimizes the **Sammon error** when added to \( F_{\text{selected}} \), and update the set: \( F_{\text{selected}} = F_{\text{selected}} \cup \{f_{\text{best}}\} \).

5. **Stopping Criterion:**
   - Continue the sequential forward selection process until:
     - A predefined number of features are selected, or
     - Adding more features does not significantly reduce the Sammon error (i.e., the improvement in Sammon error becomes negligible).

6. **Output:**
   - The output is the set of features \( F_{\text{selected}} \) that minimizes the Sammon error and preserves the structure of the data in the reduced feature space.

### Key Adjustments for Sammon Error:
- Instead of using the silhouette score (which evaluates clustering quality), you use **Sammon error** to evaluate how well the selected feature subset preserves the original data structure in a reduced-dimensional space.
- The **forward selection process** remains the same, where you add one feature at a time that minimizes Sammon error the most when combined with the currently selected features.

### Algorithm Summary:
1. **Initialize** with an empty set of selected features.
2. **Compute Sammon error** for each individual feature and select the feature that minimizes the error.
3. **Sequentially add features** by selecting the feature that minimizes the Sammon error when added to the current set of selected features.
4. **Stop** when a predefined condition is met (e.g., no significant reduction in error or a maximum number of features).

### Practical Considerations:
- **Distance metric:** Choose an appropriate distance metric, like Euclidean distance, that fits your data's characteristics.
- **Scaling:** Ensure that the data is scaled, as Sammon error is sensitive to feature magnitudes.
- **Computational complexity:** Sammon error involves calculating pairwise distances for all data points, which can be computationally intensive for large datasets. Optimizing performance might be necessary (e.g., using approximate nearest neighbors).

This approach allows you to adapt SS-SFS for unsupervised feature selection by focusing on **minimizing Sammon error**, ensuring that the selected features preserve the data's structure as well as possible.
